            WELCOME TO CHESS!
        </h1>
        <p>Chess is a game of strategy and tactics for two players, played on an 8x8 chequered board.</p>
        <p>Although chess sets come in many varieties and colours, the traditional colours are white and black,</p>
        <p>and that is how we will be referring to the two players on this website.</p>
        <p>The aim of the game is to trap your opponent's king, which is called Checkmate.</p>
        <p> A game can also be won if your opponent gives up (in chess, we call this 'resigning'),</p>
        <p> and there are a variety of ways a game can end in a draw, in which case neither player wins.</p>
        <p> We'll look at these in more detail later on.</p>
