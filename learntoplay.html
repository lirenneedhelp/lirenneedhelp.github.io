         <h4>
            Step 1. How To Setup The Chessboard
         </h4>
         <p>At the beginning of the game the chessboard is laid out so that each player</p>
         <p>has the white (or light) color square in the bottom right-hand side.</p>

     
        <img class = "responsiveimg" src = "img/chessboard.png" alt = "chessboard">

         <p>The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time. The second row (or rank) is filled with</p>
         <p>pawns. The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to them, followed by the bishops, and</p>
         <p>finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching color (white queen on white, black queen</p>
         <p>on black), and the king on the remaining square.</p>

    <section class = "section-c">
        <h4>
            Step 2. How To Move Each Piece On The Chessboard
        </h4>
        <p>Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. Pieces cannot move through other pieces</p>
        <p>(the knight can jump over other pieces which makes it an exception), and can never move onto a square</p>
        <p> with one of their pieces on it. However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which</p>
        <p> is also known as capturing. Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces</p>
        <p> (by landing on their square and then replacing them), defend their own pieces against opponent's capture threats,</p>
        <p> or control important squares in the game.</p>


        <h5>How to move a King in Chess</h5>
        <p>The king is the most important piece, but is one of the weakest.</p>
        <p> The king can only move one square -in any direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally. </p>
        <p> The king may never move himself into check (where he could be captured).</p>
        <p> When the king is attacked by another piece this is called "check"</p>

        <h5>How To Move The Queen In Chess</h5>
        <p>The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one straight direction - forward,</p>
        <p>backward, sideways, or diagonally - as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of</p>
        <p>her own pieces.</p>
        <p>And, like with all pieces, if the queen captures an opponent's piece her move is over. Notice how the</p>
        <p>white queen captures the black queen and then the black king is forced to move.</p>

        <h5>How To Move The Rook In Chess</h5>
        <p>The rook may move as far as it wants, but only forward, backward, and to the sides.</p>
        <p>The rooks are particularly powerful pieces when they are protecting each other and working together!</p>
        
        <h5>How To Move The Bishop In Chess</h5>
        <p>The bishop may move as far as it wants, but only diagonally.</p>
        <p>Each bishop starts on one color (light or dark) and must always stay on that color.</p>
        <p>Bishops work well together because they cover up each other's weaknesses.</p>

        <h5>How To Move The Knight In Chess</h5>
        <p>Knights move in a very different way from the other pieces -</p>
        <p>going two squares in one direction, and then one more move at a 90-degree angle, just like the shape of an “L”.</p>
        <p>Knights are also the only pieces that can move over other pieces.</p>

        <h5>How To Move The Pawn In Chess</h5>
        <p>Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways: they move forward but capture diagonally.</p>
        <p>Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where they can move forward two squares.</p>
        <p>Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front of them. </p>
        <p>They can never move or capture backward.</p>
        <p>If there is another piece directly in front of a pawn he cannot move past or capture that piece.</p>

        <h4>
            Step 3. Special Rules In Chess
        </h4>
        <p> There are a few special rules in chess that may not seem logical at first. </p>
        <p> They were created to make the game more fun and interesting.</p> 

        <h5> How To Promote A Pawn In Chess </h5>
        <p> Pawns have another special ability and that is that if a pawn reaches the other side of the board</p>
        <p> it can become any other chess piece (called promotion) excluding a king (or pawn, for that matter).</p>
        <p>A pawn may be promoted to a knight, bishop, rook, or queen.</p>
        <p>A common misconception is that pawns may only be exchanged for a piece that has been captured.</p>
        <p>That is NOT true. A pawn is usually promoted to a queen. Only pawns may be promoted.</p>

        <h5>How To Do "En Passant" In Chess</h5>
        <p>he last rule about pawns is called “en passant", which is French for “in passing”</p>
        <p>If a pawn moves out two squares on its first move,</p>
        <p>and by doing so lands to the side of an opponent's pawn (effectively jumping past the other pawn's ability to capture it)</p>
        <p>that other pawn has the option of capturing the first pawn as it passes by.</p>

        <img class = "responsiveimgnolimit" src = "img/enpassant.jpg" alt = "en passant">

        <p>This special move must be done immediately after the first pawn has moved past,</p>
        <p>otherwise the option to capture it is no longer available. Click through the example below</p>
        <p>to better understand this odd, but important rule.</p>

        <h5>How To Castle In Chess</h5>
        <p>One other special chess rule is called castling. This move allows you to do two important</p>
        <p>things all in one move: get your king to safety (hopefully), and get your rook out of the</p>
        <p>corner and into the game. On a player's turn he may move his king two squares over to one</p>
        <p>side and then move the rook from that side's corner to right next to the king on the</p>
        <p>opposite side. (See the example below.) However, in order to castle, the following</p>
        <p>conditions must be met:</p>

        <div>
            <ul>
        <li>it must be that king's very first move</li>
        <li>it must be that rook's very first move</li>
        <li>there cannot be any pieces between the king and rook to move</li>
        <li>the king may not be in check or pass through check</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Notice that when you castle one direction the king is closer to the side of the board. That is</p>
        <p>called castling "kingside". Castling to the other side, through where the queen sat, is called</p>
        <p>castling "queenside". Regardless of which side, the king always moves only two squares</p>
        <p>when castling.</p>

        <h4>
            Step 4. Learn Who Makes The First Move
        </h4>

        <p>The player with the white pieces always moves first. Therefore, players generally decide who</p>
        <p>will get to be white by chance or luck such as flipping a coin or having one player guess the</p>
        <p>color of the hidden pawn in the other player's hand. White then makes a move, followed by</p>
        <p>black, then white again, then black, and so on until the end of the game. Being able to</p>
        <p>move first is a tiny advantage that gives the white player an opportunity to attack right away.</p>

        <h4>
            Step 5. Rules On How To Win
        </h4>
        <p>There are several ways to end a game of chess: by checkmate, with a draw,</p>
        <p>by resignation, by forfeit on time...</p>
        <h5>How To Checkmate In Chess</h5>
        <p>The purpose of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king.</p>
        <p>This happens when the king is put into check and cannot get out of check.</p>

        <h5>There are only three ways to get out of check:</h5>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>move out of the way (though he cannot castle!)</li>
                <li>block the check with another piece or</li>
                <li>capture the piece threatening the king.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If a king cannot escape checkmate then the game is over. Customarily the king is not</p>
        <p>captured or removed from the board, the game is simply declared over.</p>

        <h5>How To Draw A Chess Game</h5>
        <p>Occasionally chess games do not end with a winner, but with a draw. There are 5 reasons</p>
        <p>why a chess game may end in a draw:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>The position reaches a stalemate where it is one player's turn to move, but his king is</li>
            </ul>
            <p>NOT in check and yet he does not have another legal move:</p>
            <img class = "responsiveimg" src = "img/stalemate.png" alt = "stalemate">
            <p>With the move Qc7, black is not threatened and can't move.</p>
            <p>The game is declared a draw by stalemate.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The players may simply agree to a draw and stop playing</li>
                <li>There are not enough pieces on the board to force a checkmate (example: a king and a bishop vs. a king)</li>
                <li>A player declares a draw if the same exact position is repeated three times (though not necessarily three times in a row)</li>
                <li>Fifty consecutive moves have been played where neither player has moved a pawn or captured a piece</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>
            Step 6: Basic Beginner Strategies
        </h4>
        <p>There are four simple things that every chess player should know:</p>

        <h5>Protect Your King</h5>
        <p>Get your king to the corner of the board where he is usually safer. Don't put off castling.</p>
        <p>You should usually castle as quickly as possible. Remember, it doesn't matter how close</p>
        <p>you are to checkmating your opponent if your own king is checkmated first!</p>

        <h5>Don't Give Pieces Away </h5>
        <p>Don't carelessly lose your pieces! Each piece is valuable and you can't win a game without</p>
        <p>pieces to checkmate. There is an easy system that most players use to keep track of the</p>
        <p>relative value of each chess piece. How much are the chess pieces worth?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>A pawn is worth 1</li>
                <li>A knight is worth 3</li>
                <li>A bishop is worth 3</li>
                <li>A rook is worth 5</li>
                <li>A queen is worth 9</li>
                <li>The king is infinitely valuable</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At the end of the game, these points don't mean anything—it is simply a system you can</p>
        <p>use to make decisions while playing, helping you know when to capture, exchange, or</p>
        <p>make other moves.</p>
        
        <h5>Control The Center Of The Chessboard</h5>
        <p>You should try and control the center of the board with your pieces and pawns. If you</p>
        <p>control the center, you will have more room to move your pieces and will make it harder</p>
        <p>for your opponent to find good squares for his pieces. In the example above white makes</p>
        <p>good moves to control the center while black plays bad moves.</p>
        
        <h5>Use All Of Your Chess Pieces</h5>
        <p>In the example above white got all of his pieces in the game! Your pieces don't do any</p>
        <p>good when they are sitting back on the first row. Try and develop all of your pieces so that</p>
        <p>you have more to use when you attack the king. Using one or two pieces to attack will not</p>
        <p>work against any decent opponent.</p>
