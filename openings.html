        <h4 id = "l">The Scandinavian Defense</h4>
        <p>The Scandinavian Defense, formerly better known in English language texts as the Center-Counter, is Black's seventh most popular response to 1.e4.</p>
        <p>Easily White's best response, and overwhelmingly its most popular, is to capture with 2.exd5. Although it is Black's first move that defines the Scandinavian,</p>
        <p>the position after that pawn capture is effectively the starting position for the opening. It's at this point where the Scandinavian really gets interesting.</p>

        <h5>Variations to The Scandinavian Defense</h5>
        <p>Black has two main second moves: recapturing with 2...Qxd5, or playing 2...Nf6 planning to recapture</p>
        <p>with the knight. The former of these options breaks the rule, often taught to players just starting out,</p>
        <p>of not developing the queen too early.</p>

        <h5>2...Qxd5</h5>
        <p>White actually has several reasonable options here, but by far the most common is 3.Nc3, immediately</p>
        <p>asking Black why the queen exposed herself so soon. The temptation as Black on move three may be</p>
        <p>to check the white king down the e-file, but this is considered inferior to three main alternatives.</p>

        <h5>3...Qa5</h5>
        <p>The most common move for Black. Black often plays ...c6 to drop the queen back to c7 at some point,</p>
        <p>develops the light-squared bishop to f5 or g4 before playing a pawn to e6. The pawns on c6 and e6</p>
        <p>create a solid structure for Black. However this is not the only way to play the position</p>

        <h5>3...Qd6</h5>
        <p> This move only becomes more popular over time. It is generally more flexible than the other options </p>
        <p> and Black often obtains an imbalanced position including, if possible, queenside castling. The fact that </p>
        <p> White can play Nb5 to attack the queen again is not a big deal for Black because it wastes time for </p>
        <p> White as well.</p>

        <h5>3...Qd8</h5>
        <p>If Black does not want to bring the queen out, this is the move to play. White can try to keep the pawn</p>
        <p>with 3.c4 or continue developing with either 3.Bb5+ or 3.d4. The tradeoff for Black is that while the</p>
        <p>queen does not come out early, the knight will have to move at least twice to regain the pawn.</p>

        <h4>How to Play Against the Scandinavian</h4>
        <p>The first key to playing against the Scandinavian as White is to always play 2.exd5. Other moves like</p>
        <p>2.Nc3 or 2.e5 are playable but only give Black an immediately equal position and are rather easy to</p>
        <p>meet naturally.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However, White has much more flexibility on move three. Even if Black captures on d5 with the</p>
        <p>queen, it is not necessary to play 3.Nc3; 3.Nf3 and 3.d4 are also good. In fact, 3.Nf3 scores 47% for</p>
        <p>White compared to 44% with 3.Nc3. No matter what, however, natural development will give White a</p>
        <p>fine position.</p>
        <img class = "responsiveimg" src = "img/scandinavian.png" alt = "scandinavian">
        <p>White has alternatives on move three.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, it's pretty much up to Black how the game will go from there. That ability to play several</p>
        <p>third moves, while White is somewhat limited, is one reason Black plays the opening despite its reputation as</p>
        <p>inferior. But it's that same reputation that gives White hope. In master play, White wins 44% of master games in</p>
        <p>the Scandinavian, compared to 40% against the French or 37% against the Sicilian.</p>

        <h4 id = "m">Italian Game</h4>
        <h5>1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4</h5>
        <p>The Italian Game is one of the oldest openings</p>
        <p>in chess and has been around for centuries. This</p>
        <p>classical 1.e4 opening can lead to slower and</p>
        <p>positional games as well as open, tactical</p>
        <p>battles. Although very common among</p>
        <p>beginners, the Italian Game is a part of the</p>
        <p>repertoire of players of every level.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Starting Position</h5>
        <p>The Italian Game starts after the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4. White develops their kingside pieces</p>
        <p>sensibly, with the knight controlling the center and the bishop attacking the weak f7-pawn through the</p>
        <p>central d5-square.</p>
        <p>With this opening, White follows the basic opening principles of fighting for the center and taking care</p>
        <p>of the king's safety. From there, the game can evolve into either tactical or positional struggles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Variations</h5>
        <p>As an opening that has been around since the 1500s, masters studied the Italian Game intensely</p>
        <p>throughout the ages. Below you can see the main variations of this opening.</p>
        <h5>Giuoco Piano</h5>

        <p>he most popular variation of the Italian Game is the Giuoco Piano, which starts after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3</p>
        <p>Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5. The name of this line is an Italian expression that can translate to "soft game" or</p>
        <p>"slow game," an indication that this variation often leads to positional games. Despite its name,</p>
        <p>White can force a more open game by playing 5.d4 and entering the Center Attack variation.</p>

        <h5>Giuoco Pianissimo</h5>
        <p>The Giuoco Pianissimo, as the name suggests, tends to lead to a "very slow game." The d2-d3 push</p>
        <p>characterizes this variation and can happen either through 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.d3 or</p>
        <p>through 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3. With this variation, White keeps the center</p>
        <p>closed and favors a more positional game.</p>

        <h5>Evans Gambit</h5>
        <p>Popularized by Captain W.D. Evans and used extensively by Paul Morphy, The Evans Gambit is</p>
        <p>suitable for the aggressive player. White gives up a wing pawn to develop quickly and create a</p>
        <p>dangerous attack on the enemy king. This variation adds spice to the slower Giuoco Piano after the</p>
        <p>moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4. Although not common at the highest levels, the Evans</p>
        <p>Gambit is one of the best-scoring lines among beginner and intermediate players.</p>


        <h4>How To Play Against The Italian Opening</h4>
        <p>The Italian Game is not one of the most challenging openings to deal with on Black's side.</p>
        <h5>Giuoco Piano: Main Lines</h5>
        <p>The Black player who enjoys a positional game can count on the main lines of the Giuoco Piano for a</p>
        <p>balanced game. Black wins 31% of games, draws 33%, and loses 36% in this line—a more than</p>
        <p>satisfactory result. Note that if Black chooses this line, they should be prepared for the Evans Gambit.</p>

        <h5>Evans Gambit Declined</h5>
        <p>Although Black can accept the gambit and still get a good game, the Evans Gambit Declined</p>
        <p>variation scores the best. With 41% of games ending in wins, 23% draws, and 36% losses, Black</p>
        <p>stands very well after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4 Bb6. The Black player can also rejoice</p>
        <p>at the fact that this variation scores remarkably well among non-professional players</p>

    <section class = "section-d">
        <h4 id = "n">Sicilian Defense</h4>

        <h5>1.e4 c5</h5>
        <p>The Sicilian Defense is the most popular response to White's 1.e4. Employed by masters and</p>
        <p>beginners alike, the Sicilian Defense is a reputable and positionally sound opening. Still, the Sicilian is</p>
        <p>a combative opening that tends to lead to dynamic and sharp positions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Since the Sicilian Defense is a fairly complex opening. It is rarely played by Beginners since there are</p>
        <p> too many variations and continuity after each moves which makes it fairly complex to play it when you are</p>
        <p> a beginner</p>

        <h5>Variations</h5>
        <h5>Sicilian Defense: Nardjof Variation</h5>

        <p>The Najdorf Variation (marked by 5. ... a6) is today the most popular</p>
        <p>line in the Sicilian. Named after Grandmaster Miguel Najdorf, this</p>
        <p>system is designed to exert control over b5 and later put pressure on</p>
        <p>White's e4 pawn. It is also a flexible idea, one that can transpose into</p>
        <p>many other Sicilian systems.​</p>
    </section>
    <section class = "section-e">
        <h4 id = "o">French Defense</h4>
        <p>The French Defense is one of the most popular Black responses to 1.e4. It has consistently been a</p>
        <p>part of masters' repertoire since the 1800s and one of the favorites of positional players. Usually</p>
        <p>leading to slower games, this opening is a good choice for players of all levels.</p>
        <h5>Variations</h5>
        <h5>French Defense: Advance Variation</h5>
        <h5>1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5</h5>
        <p>In the advance variation of the French Defense, White counters the threat to the e4 pawn by</p>
        <p>advancing the pawn, creating a space advantage with locked pawn chains in the center.</p>
    </section>
    <section class = "section-f">
        <h4 id = "p">The Ruy Lopez</h4>
        <h5>1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5</h5>
        <p>The Ruy Lopez starts after 3.Bb5. This move threatens 4.Bxc6, leaving the e5-pawn</p>
        <p>undefended. What makes this opening unique is that the threats on the d5-pawn</p>
        <p>can always be defended by the queen.</p>

        <h5>Variations</h5>
        <p>The following are some variations that can arise from playing the Ruy Lopez, let’s</p>
        <p>see how one can carefully approach them:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h5>Berlin Defense</h5>

        <h5>3…Nf6</h5>

        <p>Here Black’s plan is very clear: they are planning on castling to ensure the king’s</p>
        <p>safety and also planning to launch an attack on the e4-pawn.</p>

        <h5>4.Nc3:</h5>
        <p> This protects the e4-pawn, while also finding White develop a minor piece,</p>
        <p>which is a rule that is part of the opening fundamentals.</p>

        <h5>4.d3:</h5>
        <p>Simply just protecting the pawn and also opening a path for the dark-squared</p>
        <p>bishop to travel its way to either the e3 or g5-squares.</p>
        
        <h5>4.d4:</h5>
        <p>On this move, White gambits the pawn, creating a similar structure to the Rio</p>
        <p>Gambit. If it is accepted, this will leave White with developmental advantages,</p>
        <p>which come from attacking Black’s developed minor pieces.</p>
